# News-Categories
In this repo we are going to develop a news classification report using TF-IDF Vectorization along with the Classification model.
The Jupyter Notebook file name news classification has the full detailed EDA, feature engineering and model selection and the Jupyter Notebook file name news classification deployment has the final code that is required for the deployment.

About Dataset
Context
** Please cite the dataset using the BibTex provided in one of the following sections if you are using it in your research, thank you! **

This dataset contains around 210k news headlines from 2012 to 2022 from HuffPost. This is one of the biggest news datasets and can serve as a benchmark for a variety of computational linguistic tasks. HuffPost stopped maintaining an extensive archive of news articles sometime after this dataset was first collected in 2018, so it is not possible to collect such a dataset in the present day. Due to changes in the website, there are about 200k headlines between 2012 and May 2018 and 10k headlines between May 2018 and 2022.

Content
Each record in the dataset consists of the following attributes:

category: category in which the article was published.
headline: the headline of the news article.
authors: list of authors who contributed to the article.
link: link to the original news article.
short_description: Abstract of the news article.
date: publication date of the article.
